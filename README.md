# Social Media Prediction - IFT 6758 (Fall 2020)
## Kernels
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (https://www.kaggle.com/prabodhwankhede/exploratory-data-analysis)
2. Code for reproducing the 3 submissions on LB (https://www.kaggle.com/aravindsreeramdas/code-for-reproducing-the-3-submissions-on-lb?scriptVersionId=49936291)
3. Folly (https://www.kaggle.com/prabodhwankhede/folly?scriptVersionId=49158885)

### Note
1. The notebook titled **Exploratory Data Analysis** contains EDA for both our final submission as well as the submission that performed best but we didn't select it.
2. The code for reproducing the 3 submissions on LB come from the notebook titled **Code for reproducing the 3 submissions on LB** where each output file represents corresponding 3 chosen submissions on Kaggle.
3. The notebook named **Folly** is basically the code that outperformed the first ranking submission on the private LB but we happened to not choose it owing to its public score. The submission was made using *version 4 of 8*.
4. All our submissions are reproducible and you can submit the resulting csv files to the competition for verification.
